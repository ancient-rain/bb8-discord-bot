"Princess Leia never actually gets to 'meet' General Obi Wan Kenobi. She sees him from afar when she's escaping the Death Star as Obi-Wan is about to let Darth Vader kill him but that's it. Unless you count Obi-Wan being present for her birth in Revenge of the Sith...then she never met him.",
"Anthony Daniels, who voiced C3P0 and climbed into the tin suit, is the only actor to appear in all 8 Star Wars films - you have to count The Clone Wars animated film of course! Kenny Baker did not actually film anything for Revenge of the Sith, his parts were a mix of CGI and footage recycled from Attack of the Clones. In The Force Awakens, Artoo was a mix of manual robot and CGI as Baker was too aged to perform. RIP Kenny.",
"Empire was the first movie to have a number by its title in the opening credits being 'V'. The original Star War was not called A New Hope or Episode 4, this came later.",
"As General Kenobi is about to leave to hunt down General Grevious, he shares a nice moment with Anakin which finishes with a very loving, 'Good bye old friend' from Kenobi. This is the last time in the movie the two Jedi converse as friends. A key thing is the lighting - Anakin in the dark and Obi Wan in the light - it is a literal case of foreshadowing what was to come.",
"Bail Organa and Yoda step into the hallway of Organa's ship and have a nice coversation about being rebels or something in Sith. It's the actual ship that Darth Vader boards to capture Princess Leia Organa in the start of A New Hope.",
"Darth Vader has his own theme song written by John Williams. Known as the Imperial March it was introduced in the Empire movie and used in Jedi and in the prequels to show when Anakin was turning to the dark side of the Force.",
"In a New Hope, Leia was kept as Tarkin's prisoner on the Death Star in cell number 2187. This was a deliberate choice as 2187 is the year that the Lucas directed film THX 1138, was set.",
"The furry Ewoks were a late addition to the Star Wars mythology in Jedi. Their part in the story was to originally be played by Wookiees, but by the time Lucas and his production partners sat down to write Return of The Jedi, they realized that, because Chewbacca could fly the Millennium Falcon, repair the ship and operate pretty much any weapon or machine in the known universe, they'd made the Wookiees too technologically advanced for the plot.",
"Wedge Antilles really is Obi-Wan Kenobi's Uncle! And he made a cameo appearance in Rogue One.",
"In Jedi, listen very carefully as Darth Vader picks up the Emperor and throws him down the Death Star shaft. This is the only time the Jedi theme music plays over a shot of Vader, reflecting his return to the light side of the Force. tie fighter story board star wars",
"It's a myth the Wampa was created to allow for Luke's rearranged face after a car accident. Mark Hamill was injured prior to the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. This is fact though. The myth is that due to his face being rearranged, Lucas had to re-write the Hoth events to include the Wampa attacking Luke to account for his injury. The truth is that no accommodations were made for Hamill’s face. The myth is probably stoked by this moment from Empire that was unused.",
"After appearing in Jedi, Wedge Antilles becomes the only X-wing pilot character (apart from Luke) who survives all three major battles in the films. Luke of course only two part in two of those battles as a pilot.",
"On the Hoth planet Rebel base - recall that dude to which Han Solo retorts, \"Then I'll see you in Hell!\" just before he heads out to find a certain missing Jedi? That's Cliff Clavin from Cheers AKA John Ratzenberger. These days he does voice acting in most Pixar movies.",
"Anakin Skywalker really is the ‘Chosen one’. While Yoda and Mace Windu may have thought a mistake had been made in the reading of the prophecy, Anakin was the one who actually killed Sith Lord Palpatine by throwing him down the Death Star’s reactor shaft in Jedi and thus restored balance to the Force.",
"Harrison Ford famously was never intended to be Han Solo, he was just hanging around after American Graffitti and was helping other actors read their lines as Lucas was in the casting process. Eventually Lucas wised up and realised Harrison already had the part down cold. That's the stuff of movie making legend.",
"After Padme dies, she is returned to Naboo for burial - her body has been altered to make it appear like she was still pregnant - this is all part of the ruse to kept the existence of Leia and Luke a secret.",
"The famous reveal of the father and son relationship between Vader and Luke in The Empire Strikes Back is often misquoted as \"Luke, I am your father\". The line is actually \"No, I am your father\".",
"\"It's a trap,\" which is arguably the most famous line in the ROTJ, was, incredibly, not in the screenplay. The line was scripted as \"It's a trick!\" and was later changed post-filming after a test screening because, let's face it, \"it's a trick\" just doesn't have the same ring to it. Anyway, Princess Leia said it first in The Empire Strikes Back.",
"While Return of the Jedi saw Luke return the favour to Vader and cut his arm off, the idea for it actually came from the expanded universe novel, ‘Splinter of the Mind's Eye’. This book was intended to be turned into a sequel to Star Wars but when that movie became so popular, the idea was abandoned. Vader was actually the only Star Wars film character to lose an arm three times! And both his legs as well. Obi Wan Kenobi got 3 of his limbs in Revenge of the Sith!",

"George Lucas at one stage considered using the great actor and director Orsen Welles as the voice actor for Darth Vader.",
"It's a myth that George Lucas had 12 films all mapped out before the first Star Wars was released. That’s the legend but the mythology of it has grown over the years. The nutshell is that Lucas wrote a great deal of material when he was developing his little sci-fi adventure. Based around a so called “Journal of Whills”, Lucas script eventually was cut up and Star Wars as we know it was filmed. It was not until Empire Strikes Back came out that the term Episode 5 was mentioned officially. Lucas’s grand vision was actually pieced together over several years in very broad strokes. The 12 or 9 films as most people know of were never fully scripted but were largely imaginings of Lucas that were eventually firmly realized well after 1977",
"The script for A New Hope was heavily influenced by Frank Herbert's Dune novel - several concepts were taken from it.",
"In ROTS, a quick character cameo occurs when Vader and the Emperor are standing on the bridge of a Star Destroyer, overlooking the initial construction stage of the Death Star. In a blink an you'll miss it moment, a young Moff Tarkin quietly sidles up to the Sith Lords. Moff Tarkin features heavily in A New Hope, it is he who orders the destruction of the planet Alderaan.",
"During the opera scene of ROTS, Palpatine tells Anakin about how Darth Plagueis was so powerful he could create life. While it's never made explicit, the film could have been suggesting that Darth Plagueis caused the 'immaculate conception' of Anakin Skywalker. The Expanded Universe novels show that Plagueis certainly was capable of such an amazing act...",
"Jedi was originally going to be called Revenge of the Jedi until Lucas decided that Jedi do not seek revenge. This was quite late in the production so there was a lot of promotional gear with the title already printed on it.",
"Mark Hamill received a black eye when filming the famous 'Dianoga' attack in the Trash Compactor scene from A New Hope which meant he was filmed from one side only for the rest shooting that scene.",
"Princess Leia was subject to one of the most famous ad libs in cinema history - that being Han Solo's response to her declaration of love - \"I know\". Harrison Ford apparently made it up at Irvine Kershner's suggestion. Leia got to return the line in Jedi during the Battle of Endor.",
"E.T. made a cameo appearance in The Phantom Menace.",
"If you asked the average Star Wars fan what was Leia’s home world, they would be correct in answering the planet Alderraan and they could go to the head of the class. If you asked the most hard core fan, they might also quickly add that Leia and Luke were actually born at a medical facility on Polissa Massa – if you’ve seen Revenge of the Sith you might recall that is where Obi Wan Kenobi took the injured Padme for medical assistance.",
"ANH famously featured the milk at the Lar's family breakfast scene.",
"Rogue One features the same blue milk in Saw's cavern.",
"Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time in A New Hope!facts and trivia about The Empire Strikes Back",

"While Return of the Jedi saw Luke return the favour to Vader and cut his arm off, the idea for it actually came from the expanded universe novel, ‘Splinter of the Mind's Eye’. This book was intended to be turned into a sequel to Star Wars but when that movie became so popular, the idea was abandoned.",
"Vader was actually the only Star Wars film character to lose an arm three times! And both his legs as well. Obi Wan Kenobi got 3 of his limbs in Revenge of the Sith! (he had the higher ground...).",

"George Lucas at one stage considered using the great Orsen Welles as the voice actor for Darth.",
"When Jango Fett gets into his ship after his fight with Obi-Wan in Attack of the Clones, he bangs his head on the open door. This was intentional, and is a reference to a famous goof from the orginal movie where a cloned storm trooper accidentally bangs his head on a door (the clone being the descendant of Jango Fett and having inherited this character trait). luke darth duel story board star wars",
"Carrie Fisher has spoken many times of her struggles with bipolar disorder. You wouldn't wish this on any anybody.",
"Harrison Ford and Fisher had an affair during the film of A New Hope. Ford was married at the time.",
"Leia's character has her own musical theme titled \"Princess Leia's Theme\". It is represented by the musical leitmotif method which is famously used across the films. The piece was composed by John Williams and was used several times. It first appeared in A New Hope, heard when Princess Leia is captured by the evil Sith Lord, Darth Vader. Later, it surfaces as R2-D2 plays her holographic message to Obi-Wan Kenobi. The also theme plays when Kenobi is killed by Vader and it makes an appearance in the credits of the movie. It also is used in the two follow up movies and the Revenge of the Sith prequel when her adoptive father Bail Organa introduces her to her adoptive mother.",
"In the original drafts of Star Wars, Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker were definitely different people - it wasn’t until the development of script for The Empire Strikes Back that the two were combined as one character. This means Darth Vader does not mean Dark Father and the name was not a hint as to Luke's parentage.",
"Lord Vader’s famous leitmotif theme music is known as The Imperial March and was not introduced until Empire Strikes Back.",
"It's a myth that Splinter of the Mind's Eye was the scripted sequel to A New Hope. The truth is the book ‘Splinter of the Mind’s Eye’ was commissioned by Lucas as a potential sequel to Star Wars. The myth is that the novel was written based off a script written by George Lucas. There was no written script at all - Alan Dean Foster was writing the novelisation of Star Wars and also a second book. He was as simply instructed by Lucas to write the book based off some ideas and film treatments that George threw at him. Lucas could then turn it into a film script down the line, if he so chose. The reality is that when Star Wars 'went global' Lucas changed gears and the sequel script was first drafted by Leigh Bracket, which after her death from cancer, Lucas refined further with help from Lawrence Kasdan.",
"Boba Fett was first seen in The Empire Strikes Back right? Nope, technically his first appearance was in an animated segment of The Star Wars Holiday Special. It is the only good part of that movie.",
"Bobba also actually made his first public appearance in a Star Wars street parade before either movie!",
"Frank Oz who is the voice for the most famous little green guy in cinema history, Yoda was also the voice of the Muppet’s Miss Piggy. It was because of his talents that he developed with Jim Henson that saw him get the call up. He also did the puppetry.",
"A very early draft of the Emire saw Han Solo going in search of his Father-In-Law, Ovan Marekal, who has political ties with Lord Vader.",
"In Revenge of the Sith Darth Vader's head was symmetrical for the first time in a Star Wars film. It was developed using precise machinery - the original was hand sculpted and was mildly aspherical!",
"The classic \"The first transport is away!\" line from Empire Strikes Back was delivered by Mark Hamill.",
"George Lucas took a lot of his inspiration from a film called The Hidden Fortress. It featured a pair of bickering sidekicks who served as comic relief and crucially managed to help keep the plot ticking along. Lucas adopted this concept and applied it to the robots.",
"C3PO's most famous quote is perhaps \"I suggest a new strategy, Artoo: let the Wookie win.\" which pretty much speaks for itself!",
"The original drafts for Star Wars show that the Skywalker family was actually called Starkiller. Indeed the drafts featured a General Starkiller and didn’t focus on the young moisture farmer from Tatooine. His son was called Deak. He eventually became Luke.",
"In ESB's original script treatment Luke Skywalker flies to the 'Bog' Planet where he meets a frog-like Jedi named 'Minch', who teaches him the ways of the force. That's right, Yoda was frog-like and was going to be called Minch. Can you image it, \"But Master Minch, you cannot die!\"",
"A lot of people miss it, thinking the C3PO is totally golden but his right leg is silver from beneath the knee joint. In The Force Awakens he had a red arm for a time but at the end of the movie has gone back to what we presume was the original gold.",
"R2D2 stands at a height of 96cm.",
"George Lucas made his first Star Wars cameo in Revenge of the Sith. He dressed as a Pantoran senator, Baron Papanoida. You might not have recognised him as he all dressed up in blue body paint! His daughter also cameoed with him at the same time. His son Jedi appears as a padwan Jedi that is killed by the Stormtroopers as he attempts to make contact with Bail Organa. trivia about Qui Gon Jinn",
"Coincidentally or not, the filming code name for Return of the Jedi was Blue Harvest.",

"The planet name of 'Coruscant' was created by Star Wars author Timothy Zahn for his book Heir to The Empire.

The main character Thrawn from those books eventually featured in the third season of Star Wars: Rebels.",

"C3P0 has appeared in every Star Wars movie including Rogue One, TFA and the Clone Wars.",
"It was Donnie Yen's idea for his Rogue One character Chirrut Imwe to be blind. Director Gareth Edwards thought it was cool and ran with it. Yen initially turned down the role when it was first offered to him however when he told his kids about the chance, they were so excited, he changed his mind.",

"When Luke claims Chewbacca is a prisoner transfer from cell block. 1138, this is a direct reference to George Lucas’s first film, THX 1138. That film was about a dystopian future where a authoritarian regime was in control – a not to dissimilar state of affairs in Star Wars.",

"R2D2 is taller than the Ewok 'Wicket' from ROTJ.",
"Mace Windu is the only Jedi in any film to wield a purple colored lightsaber. Here's some of his quotes from the prequels.",
"None of the Star Wars films have credits at the beginning of them. This actually became a really big deal and meant Lucas quit various film institutions such as the Director's Guild and Stars Wars films were considered independent movies.",
"R2D2 and C3PO were snuck into a scene in Indianna Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark as well as JJ Abrams' two Star Trek films.",
"The Phantom Menace's production sets were built only as high as the tops of the actors' heads and computer graphics filled in the rest. But it was realised that Liam Neeson was so tall that they needed to build things taller and this cost the production another $150,000 in construction costs.",

"E.T. creatures made a cameo appearance in The Phantom Menace",
"Darth Maul has ten horns on his red head.",
"While Ray Park is famous as playing the Sith Lord, Peter Serafinowicz actually voiced the character.

Benicio del Toro was originally cast but dropped out. He has a part in Star Wars The Last Jedi as DJ, a slicer of dubious renown.",
"Actor Hayden Christiansen played Darth Vader in Revenge of the Sith as opposed to David Prowse who previously did the role. Hayden apparently begged Lucas to let him play him. The suit had to be designed to accommodate his smaller stature than Prowse's. Not that Lucas would have cast Prowse as he appears to have something against him and he was banned from making any appearances at official Star Wars promotional events such as conventions.",

"In Rogue One the planet Jedha features a place known as the 'Temple of the Whills'. This is a great reference to some obscure Star Wars trivia - The Journal of the Whills was a formal record of history, maintained by a beings known as The Whills. During the original Star Wars writing period, George Lucas had the idea that R2D2 relayed the stories he knew to the Whills so that the Skywalker saga could be recorded for all time.",
"R2D2 was infamously given the ability to fly in the prequel films which bugged many fans (despite the fun he had on screen). This was rather roughly explained in other fiction that after the Clone Wars the company responsible for the development of his boosters went out of business. When his rocket boosters were damaged they were unable to be repaired.",
"Every clone trooper in Revenge of the Sith is a creation of CGI. No clone costumes or helmets were manufactured for filming. It's like the anti-Lord of the Rings mentality...",

"When Jango Fett gets into his ship after his fight with Obi-Wan in Attack of the Clones, he bangs his head on the open door.

"\"Phantom Menace\" was the name of a villain in the \"Flash Gordon\" comics. Which shouldn't surprise too many people as George Lucas has often cited Flash Gordon as one of his inspirations for making the original Star Wars. In the film of Flash Gordon, Max von Sydow played villain, Ming the Merciless. Sydow of course had a turn as The Force Awakens as Lor San Tekka.clone trooper story board star wars",
"Revenge of the Sith is the only film in the main saga story line thus far that does not feature R2D2 in the final shot. You could argue the same for The Force Awakens too, however he's at least on the island....",

Their part in the story was to be played by the Wookiees, but by the time Lucas and his production partners sat down to write Return of The Jedi, they realized that, because Chewbacca could fly the Millennium Falcon, repair the ship and operate pretty much any weapon or machine in the known universe, they'd made the Wookiees too technologically advanced for the plot.",
"Admiral Ackbar's backstory is that he was once the slave of Grand Moff Tarkin, as well as his personal pilot.",

"It took six people to work the full-sized animatronic of Jabba the Hutt. The frogs he ate were not real.",
"Jedi was the first Star Wars film to show a light saber combat something other than another light saber. On Jabba's Sail Barge, Luke fights the guards  bearing staffs and blasters. This perhaps a call back to the original movie where Luke wears a blaster helmet and tries to anticipate blast shots from the Remote on the Millennium Falcon. This shows the progress Luke has made as a Jedi Knight.",
"Speaking of that Remote, it makes a return in The Force Awakens. Finn finds it when he is looking for first aid to help Chewbacca.",
"A venerable if maverick Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn was a student of the living Force. Unlike other Jedi Masters, who often lose themselves in the meditation of the unifying Force, Qui-Gon Jinn lived for the moment, espousing a philosophy of \"feel, don't think -- use your instincts.\"",
